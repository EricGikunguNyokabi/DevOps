Step 1: Basics of CLI
1. Navigating the file system
    >pwd (Print Working Directory)
    >ls #basic listing
    >ls -l #detailed listing
    >ls -a #show hidden files

    >cd (change directory)
    >cd .. #go one level up
    >cd ~ #go to home directory

2. Managing files and directories
    >touch file.txt
    >mkdir filename
    >rmdir filename
    >cp filename.txt newfilename.txt
    >cp -r folder1 folder2 #coppy a directory
    
    mv -move or rename files
    >mv file.txt newlocation/
    >mv oldname.txt newname.txt
    >rm file.txt
    >rm -r folder #remove a directory

3. Viewing and editing files
    >touch filename #create file
    >cat file.txt #view file
    >less filename #for long files
    >namo or vim #opens file for editing
    >nano file.txt
    >vim file.txt

4. File permissions
    >ls -l #view file permission 
    -rw-r--r--  1 user group  4096 Dec 31  2024 file.txt

    rw- → Read, write permissions for owner.
    r-- → Read-only for group and others.

    >chmod #change permission
    chown eric file.txt
    chmod 755 file.txt → Sets rwxr-xr-x
    >chmod 644 file.txt #Owner can read/write, others can only read
    >chmod +x script.sh #Make a file executable
    >sudo chown user:group file.txt

5. Searching for files in a directory
    >find /path -name "file.txt"
    >grep "text" file.txt #search for text within files
    grep "error" log.txt

6. System monitoring 
    >top #View active processes.
    >df -h #Show disk usage.
    >free -m #Check memory usage.

    Disk Usage:

    Command: df -h → Disk usage in human-readable format.
    Memory Usage:

    Command: free -h.
    System Uptime:

    Command: uptime

7. Practice Tasks
Create a directory named linux_practice and navigate to it.
Inside linux_practice, create three files: file1.txt, file2.txt, and file3.txt.
Rename file1.txt to renamed_file.txt.
Copy file2.txt into a new directory named backup.
List all files in linux_practice with detailed information.
Change permissions of renamed_file.txt to allow only the owner to read and write.
